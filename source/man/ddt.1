\fBddt\fR \- unit\-testing tool for shell scripts
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBddt\fR [\-h|\-V] [\-q|\-v] [\-c \fIwhen\fR] [\-p \fIprefix\fR] [\fIplan\fR \.\.\.]
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBddt\fR is a unit\-testing tool for shell scripts and other command\-line tools which is based on (and largely compatible with) roundup(1)\. It accepts one or more \'test plans\', bash shell scripts containing functions that represent individual tests\. If a test plan is not specified, the current directory will be searched for files ending in \.ddtt\.
.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR, \fB\-\-longhelp\fR
Displays this help information and exits\.
.
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Displays version information and exits\.
.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
Displays trace information for failing tests\.
.
.TP
\fB\-q\fR, \fB\-\-quiet\fR
Hides all output\. Useful when only the exit status matters\.
.
.TP
\fB\-c\fR \fIwhen\fR, \fB\-\-colour\fR \fIwhen\fR, \fB\-\-color\fR \fIwhen\fR
Specifies when output should be colourised\. \fIwhen\fR may be \'auto\', \'always\', or \'never\' (\'auto\' is the default)\.
.
.TP
\fB\-p\fR \fIprefix\fR, \fB\-\-prefix\fR \fIprefix\fR
Sets the DDT_PREFIX environmental variable and passes it to all test plans\. This variable is meant to support comparative testing amongst versions of a test target located under different paths\. However, the test plan must be explicitly designed to support this behaviour; if it isn\'t, this option will have no special effect\.
.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-summarise\fR, \fB\-\-summarize\fR
Outputs only the plan names and a final summary of the test results\.
.
.TP
\fB\-W\fR, \fB\-\-paths\fR
Prints the absolute paths of the test plan(s) that would be executed, but doesn\'t actually execute them\.
.
.TP
\fIplan\fR \.\.\.
Specifies one or more files to use as test plans\. If none are specified, the current directory will be searched for files ending in \fB\.ddtt\fR\.
.
.SH "EXIT STATUS"

.
.P
\fB0\fR \~\~ All tests completed successfully\.
.
.br
